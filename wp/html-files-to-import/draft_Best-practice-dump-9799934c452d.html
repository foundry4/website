In a fast paced, competitive world, it’s innovate or die. Naturally, this will need to be be executed using best practice in order to gain buy-in from stakeholders. Right?</blockquote><figure name="74d5" id="74d5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*z1kDk90QkrGMKs4HdDyBNg.jpeg" data-width="3071" data-height="3071" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z1kDk90QkrGMKs4HdDyBNg.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by Kat J</figcaption></figure><h4 name="eea5" id="eea5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">It’s a plan</h4><p name="1ac9" id="1ac9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Sounds great. No one is going to argue with that. Innovation, assured by best practice. Documents are written, PowerPoint decks proclaim the vision, objectives are cascaded, teams are mobilised and, before you know it, you’ve got <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">conflict</em>. Too progress is grinding, and pretty soon it’s looking like it’s too little, too late.</p><p name="2867" id="2867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is the team not capable of executing on the vision? Unlikely. Smart people who know what’s good for their careers will keep quiet and carefully toe the line. They know better than to argue, but can see the writing on the wall, and will work around it with studied positivity. Front-line talent gets frustrated and politely (or vocally) exits your business. You find yourself struggling to recruit from your local talent pool and you start feeling like you’re having to build what you can out of dead wood.</p><h4 name="afd7" id="afd7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Frustrating</h4><p name="c70f" id="c70f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It feels like you’re managing imbeciles. The irony is your people are far smarter and more pragmatic than they might appear, and this collective potential energy isn’t active. How can you access and amplify this energy and talent?</p><p name="0b8a" id="0b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gallup reports that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/224012/dismal-employee-engagement-sign-global-mismanagement.aspx" data-href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/224012/dismal-employee-engagement-sign-global-mismanagement.aspx" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dismal Employee Engagement Is a Sign of Global Mismanagement</a>: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">85% of employees are not engaged or actively disengaged at work</em>. The report goes on to say, “The economic consequences of this global norm are approximately $7 trillion in lost productivity”. It turns out our received wisdom on management and leadership best practice is massively damaging.</p><blockquote name="fdb3" id="fdb3" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Activating collective intelligence is more than a critical business advantage, it’s a humanitarian imperative.</blockquote><p name="3e80" id="3e80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Why are the smarts leaking away? It’s as if the radiators are on full blast but your warmth is going straight out of the window. Margaret Heffernan has an insightful TED talk about Super chickens, so you probably do have the makings of a high performing team. How do you bring that energy on-stream so work flows?</p><p name="f35a" id="f35a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Make your choice</p><p name="6678" id="6678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The difficulty is that someone has to be willing to take the fall. To point out that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes, however politely, is to risk a career-limiting engagement. Good people will test the water to judge receptivity to their feedback and will move on pretty quickly where that water is cold.</p><p name="4ec4" id="4ec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been reading Good Strategy, Bad Strategy and the author’s answer would be clear. Strategy requires making hard choices. Concentrating resources on what you’ve chosen and, by extension, diverting them away from what you’ve chosen against. A strategy typically only has meaning if doing the opposite would also be a viable course of action. Otherwise i’s not actually a choice. Choosing between innovation and business as usual is over such choice.</p><p name="4c16" id="4c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Best practice can be established for stable, predictable repeatable, well-known work. This is, by definition, the opposite of innovation. If you’re operating in a predictable world, your best bet is to focus on planning and optimising. High certainty, low change, aggregation of marginal gains. Disciplined execution of best practice is only an advantage in a space already crowded with competitors. The aim is to do it better than the rest.</p><p name="a4b1" id="a4b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Innovation is about breaking new ground. That’s going to need new approaches, new thinking, new technology. It’s by definition a creative endeavour. That’s a double whammy for best practice: first, creativity isn’t linear and second your desired end state is unknown. You absolutely need direction, but it’s not possible to define the result. What’s more, you may need to change direction as you discover more about the terrain.</p><p name="1914" id="1914" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re exploring an unknown country there’s no point asking for a map. If you know your destination, just Google it. When exploring, you’ll need fast-feedback, experimentation and constant course correction — agile working.</p><p name="8ae0" id="8ae0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Great by Choice, Jim Collins contrasts the approaches of Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen to conquering the pole. Scott’s approach was absolutely best practice, reusing the well tested technologies and approaches of the day — donkeys to pull sleds. He planned the expedition up front and there’s no doubt he did it my the book. The problem was it was the wrong book. The failure may have been heroic but ultimately it was a tragic loss.</p><p name="7d53" id="7d53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From a best practice perspective, Amundsen’s approach made no sense. Agile working is still fundamentally misunderstood by a good number people I talk to. I can empathize. The apparent lack of a detailed plan and timeline send life madness — until you realise that sucking to the wrong plan is as close as you can get to a guarantee of failure.</p><p name="84aa" id="84aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amundsen, in contrast to Scott, embodied principles similar to Discovery snd Fail Fast. He spent time with local people and learnt that using donkeys to pull sleds was a terrible idea. Donkeys sweat. In Arctic conditions, sweat freezes, with fatal consequences for the animals you’re relying on. Dogs weren’t on Scott’s “approved technology” list but it turns out they were “the right tool for the job”.</p><p name="ef17" id="ef17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Scott conjoined bitterly of bad luck as reality deviated further from his plan. His team bravely man-hauled sledges, but as they feel further behind and the weather closed in, the expedition, started with great fanfare, turned into a death march and ultimately failed.</p><p name="535a" id="535a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amundsen, working to a radically different definition of disciplined execution, put in place layers of falkback and course-correction. By focusing on uncertainty as the key threat to success, he, for example, laid out multiple supply depots for each stage of the journey, extending a mile either side of the planned route.</p><p name="d100" id="d100" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most were never used — a parallel to failing fast with prototyping, or dining multiple discoveries. In a well-known world, this duplication of effort would be waste, but in an uncertain world, where an unexpected blizzard could send you far off course, this was a lifeline for his team.</p><p name="c876" id="c876" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a56d" id="a56d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A controlled environment, one where there are barriers to trying alternative approaches and technologies, is suited to business as usual, standard operating procedures, solid process: best practice. If you want to do what’s been done before, hopefully slightly better you’re on to a winner.</p><p name="7a4f" id="7a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But of you want innovation, forget it. This should be sounding obvious, but may also be surprising. If you’ve ever worked on a Digital Transformation team that’s tried to make progress in spite of the restrictions of corporate process, you’ll know how this neuters impact and pace all but completely.</p><p name="bd0b" id="bd0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly if you’re trying to manage business as usual, perhaps maintaining the integrity and security of a business critical corporate network, or managing operational teams, the risk of allowing unknown and untrusted technology and thinking to destabilise an optimised system is going to severely hamper team, technology and ultimately business performance.</p><p name="b86d" id="b86d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Activating high performance</p><p name="ce9c" id="ce9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The stronger the personality of the leader and the stronger their conviction, the less likely anyone who values their job, let alone their career progression, is likely to raise a head above the parapet.</p><p name="0822" id="0822" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of my all-time favourite TED talks is Kathryn Schultz’s “On Being Wrong”. The curse of competence is that being wrong feels exactly like being right. Right up until the devastating moment you realise maybe you’re not.</p><p name="eeb5" id="eeb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a special kind of leader that can control their personal blast-radius and demonstrate to their team that these moments are a safe space for their team to occupy. Conversely, at every level in an organisation, teams are adept at assessing, or holding back until they see evidence of, a leader’s personality.</p><p name="5624" id="5624" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that the extent to which you can activate a high performing team is highly correlated to the extent to which you invest in your “inner work”.</p><p name="e641" id="e641" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Accepting your imperfections, actively proving psychological safety in the small moments and being clear that we’re all on this journey together are some of the key indicators which, demonstrate your, in the Brené Brown sense of the word, capacity for vulnerability and connection, which in turn makes it possible for your team to show up.</p><p name="07ed" id="07ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me this is the most powerful, the most terrifying and the most non-negotiable foundation for building a high performing team.</p><p name="97ea" id="97ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Technology is a mirror</p><p name="4e29" id="4e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see this scenario plated out in technical teams. Perhaps because you can’t fudge technology. Computers have no feelings and will take your instructions literally. They’ll do exactly what you tell them. As a result there brutally and unabashedly honest about how well your theory works in practice.</p><p name="bd70" id="bd70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve written enough code to have learnt this the hard way. There’s a humility that develops from being repeatedly thwarted by your own perception of the world and having to face up to the reality that there’s nothing and no one to blame.</p><p name="0c5e" id="0c5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s an exact and inexorable conclusion of my own thinking. One consolation is that you get rapid and reliable feedback from a machine. It doesn’t try to play nicely. It is, in an uncomfortably direct sense, kind and honest.</p></div></div></section>
