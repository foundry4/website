It is one thing to intellectually be aware of the fact that #OneTeamGov had become this massive movement but it is something else to see it in the flesh! It was really quite remarkable.</p><p name="576e" id="576e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spent the day chatting to friends old and new, introducing people to each other, promoting #weeknotes and my jobs newsletter and generally having a lovely day. What I didn’t do is attend any sessions. Nor did I get into any deep conversations about ‘fixing government’ — in fact I politely excused myself from a couple as they warmed up. That just isn’t where my head is anymore. I admire the passion of those who are forever tilting at those windmills — and there seemed to be a lot of them— but my ambitions are much narrower these days.</p><p name="aff4" id="aff4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The original Govcamp folks are my people I guess — before GDS was even a consideration let along OTG. I’ve been in and around these conversations a long time now one way or another. I burned out and became a bit cynical despite some wins. Battle scarred I’ve retreated. Hell I’m not even #ofthegovernment anymore. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">For now.</em></p><p name="7348" id="7348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OneTeamGov is a much broader church than we ever were back in the day — more people, more backgrounds, more seniority. The context has changed (for financial crisis read Brexit) but a crisis is a crisis and they shouldn’t be wasted. Everyone seems more enthusiastic and positive than I can ever remember us ever being and I really do hope they succeed where we…well we didn’t fail as much as stumble. They need to find their own way and that is going to mean having a lot of the same conversations as have been happening for a decade. There is no way to avoid that and me sitting in the room sighing and going all <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“in my day we walked five miles in the snow with bare feet to engage with our users”</em> is not going to help. I’m removing my cynicism from the equation for a while — it is time for fresh ideas and approaches. Or even the old approaches with some fresh faces!</p><p name="7ea9" id="7ea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All this said it is clear #weeknotes has become integrated in to the OTG world and that sub-community is incredibly important to me — I’m honoured to have played a tiny part in that group coming together so I’m going nowhere.</p><p name="3566" id="3566" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also I’m thinking of broadening out the scope of the jobs I cover in my newsletter to better reflect the breadth of the OTG community — not entirely sure how yet to be honest!</p><p name="fba0" id="fba0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So anyway — it was an AMAZING event. All the organisers, volunteers, international travellers and everyone else should be VERY proud. Seriously. I was proud just to know some of you.</p></div></div></section>
