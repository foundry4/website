As in tech, so in life. You’ll find echoes of the transition from control to collective whatever types of systems we work on — technology, teams, organisations, legistlation — if you have a transformed mindset, you’ll find this naturally expresses itself.</p><p name="bc87" id="bc87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the mindset is centralised, you’ll struggle to, say, introduce decentralised technology like <a href="https://slack.com" data-href="https://slack.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slack messaging</a>. Even with clear, specific examples of improved pace, collaboration and massive improvements in business outcomes, a centralised mindset will, like an immune system, systemically reject it. The rationalisation of this process will feel sensible and safe to incumbent thinking, whilst at the same time maintaining a protective blindness to the elephant in the room of positive change.</p><p name="2ce1" id="2ce1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To an outside observer it looks at best like self-harming and at worst mad, daft or just plain nasty, but to the incumbent thinking it’s a protection mechanism. A deeply human immune reaction to foreign ways of thinking. Evolution is an unpredictable and discontinuous process. It’s painful. It rips and tears at our coping mechanisms. It’s frightening to realise you need to let go of what kept you safe in the past, despite that being the very thing that’s harming you now.</p><p name="63d3" id="63d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some parts of an organisation (I’m thinking of “Digital” teams) tend to break away before the rest of the organism is ready, further expressing the rifts. Like a caricature of parents and children, one camp sees the other as dinosaurs and road-blocks, whilst the other sees the one as dangerous, unruly and needing to be brought to order.</p><p name="a05f" id="a05f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I regularly see this pattern. Technology that comes from a different mindset creates dissonance. If the organisation is close enough to the edge to cross the chasm it be the kick needed to trigger evolution, but it can also trigger backlash if the organisation isn’t ready and the existing mindset reasserts itself for the time being. I think we’re seeing this in the UK with the systematic neutralisation of the Government Digital Service, even whilst other countries are admiring and forging ahead with transformation, citing the UK as an inspiration.</p><p name="5de3" id="5de3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The British organism isn’t ready to accept the change and whilst the avant-garde provided a bright star by which other nations have set their course, the rest of the body will take longer to consolidate and accept that evolution is an existential imperative. Sometimes you have to go back to what you still believe is your safe place before you finally realise it’s empty, cold and, frankly dangerous to your survival.</p><p name="2c12" id="2c12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whilst centralised, monolithic software is transitioning to a network of services, you’ll see centralised command-and-control organisations are transitioning to a network of teams. Where an Enterprise Service Bus used to hierarchically manage interactions between components, you’ll now see flat teams of peer-to-peer microservices, echoing the transition from top-down positional project management to multidisciplinary teams of expert equals.</p><p name="12b1" id="12b1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="874b" id="874b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you see it like this, it feels like the clue really is in the name. The reality is names don’t always communicate. In technology, as in life, names are part of good design. Not everything is well designed, or wants to be transparent and display clear intentions. In this case the name works.</p><p name="c703" id="c703" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
