They’re actually cheaper to run on many levels, but the real cost is one many of us struggle to pay. The ego has got to go.</p><p name="ed21" id="ed21" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="d93d" id="d93d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Low ego, high achievement</h4><p name="e456" id="e456" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the kind of simplicity that takes courage to stand up for. The kind it’s all too easy for someone to take a poke at and unintentionally fracture and lose the very thing that’s delivering for you. “Best practice” accidentally killing the golden goose.</p><p name="0aa2" id="0aa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were no complex architectural diagrams, no buzzwords, no impressive Wizard of Oz project plans that would inevitably blow up in smoke a few steps down the line.

We pulled together — in it for the team and the mission — working as one. Collectively we achieved something few enterprises manage by design: we delivered something that really worked.
