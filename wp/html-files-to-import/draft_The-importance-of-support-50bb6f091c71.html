For some, this may feel close to the bone. Rest assured this is intended with kindness. I’m posting it to help us all be a little more human and a honest about how teams can struggle to work together and why projects become harder than they need to be.</blockquote><figure name="6749" id="6749" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*SoRt06-YX3GNLgQSGr0TYw.jpeg" data-width="4207" data-height="2805" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SoRt06-YX3GNLgQSGr0TYw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Image credit <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/wk833OrQLJE" data-href="https://unsplash.com/photos/wk833OrQLJE" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">_HealthyMond</a></figcaption></figure><p name="d51d" id="d51d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve beed doing technology projects for almost twenty years. I’ve been a developer, an architect, a designer, an IT consultant, a tech lead, a startup CTO, a tech team recruiter, a culture hacker and a Digital Transformation advocate, with a message that leadership mindset and the design of your organisation are pass/fail for survival.</p><blockquote name="deac" id="deac" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Most importantly, I’ve been a support engineer.</blockquote><p name="53d8" id="53d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">More than once, and more than nominally. </p><p name="d0e1" id="d0e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I worked as a third-line support engineer for American enterprise software company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentum" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentum" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Documentum</a>. That experience heightened my incredulity at the trust — regularly broken — large organisations put in enterprise software vendors. It seemed there was no serious look at the reality behind the sales pitch. Technology was bought at C-level and thrown over the wall to technical teams. Not only was delivering a working solution that added value to their businesses slow, agonising and expensive, it disheartened and disengaged their own people. In the end, “choking the throat” for the next few years sapped time, energy and money that ultimately dwarfed the cost of a good internal team working with open source software and libraries.</p><p name="400d" id="400d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was part of the team that rebuilt <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" data-href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Rail Enquiries</a> in 2008 and part of the team that supported it when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2009_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_snowfall#Transport" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2009_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_snowfall#Transport" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">snow came down in 2009</a>. I learnt quickly about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_%28computing%29" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">load average</a>. It’s a number that tells you about the processing capacity of your server. Put simply, zero to one means you’ve got spare capacity. One to two means you’re starting to struggle. I saw it peak over 1000. The solution was to double the number of servers. Twice. Just to cope with one day every five years (this is why <a href="https://medium.com/@davidcarboni/demystifying-cloud-its-procurement-and-agile-93b67f593e33" data-href="https://medium.com/@davidcarboni/demystifying-cloud-its-procurement-and-agile-93b67f593e33" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">on-demand cloud scaling</a> is great). </p><p name="3fb5" id="3fb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I also learnt was that, had the NRE system not been designed as simply and cleanly as it was, those numbers could have been 10x. The back-end content management system (<a href="https://www.alfresco.com/" data-href="https://www.alfresco.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alfresco</a>) was fairly new back then and, for reasons that ultimately came down to complexity (both the underlying software and how we customised it) regularly locked up. </p><p name="294f" id="294f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve seen first hand the self-harm that comes from siloed functions “throwing it over the wall” without understanding or having empathy for the people who have to catch it. To be generous, that’s often been because the person above them in a command-and-control hierarchy didn’t — or couldn’t — give them space, autonomy and discretion to do better (a pattern which repeats up to the top of those pyramids). </p><p name="5b65" id="5b65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve had the pain an the privilege of being both the thrower and the catcher. Sometimes I’ve been able to throw something in one role and then switch roles to be the person who catches. I ate my own dogfood. I found out how damaging my past self had been and I learnt to care for my future self, whether that would be me or someone else in the catcher’s shoes.</p><h4 name="0648" id="0648" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Simplicity</h4><p name="2561" id="2561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The hardest possible thing is simplicity. I work hard to get to it. I struggle to create it and that struggle is so important.
