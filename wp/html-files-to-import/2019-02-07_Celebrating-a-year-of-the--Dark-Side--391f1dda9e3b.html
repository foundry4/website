I had only the vaguest idea of what I was going to be doing (initially in Swansea) and after a long career avoiding working on the supplier side of things (apart from my unsuccessful sort of hybrid role at mySociety where I really struggled) I wasn’t really sure what I was letting myself in for.</p><p name="6311" id="6311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did know a couple of the founders though and a long conversation with James (Herbert, our CEO) had convinced me of the ambition and principles of the company (that was really a start-up) and given I was spiralling downwards a bit (for the second or third time in a couple of years) I decided to take a bit of a leap — especially as they were willing to do the same for me.</p><p name="e247" id="e247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I honest the first few weeks I really wasn’t sure I had made the right decision — I liked the team in Swansea and the client but I didn’t really have a clear remit and felt at a bit of a loose end (that did not last!). Thing evolved quickly though and I have to say it has been one of the most enjoyable and interesting years of my career.</p><p name="2572" id="2572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learned to write proposals and do pitches (even won a couple!), got a much better understanding of the economics of things on this side of the table (albeit I still have a LOT to learn), realised I am a better interim leader than a traditional consultant and a better alpha/beta style squad leader than either. My coaching style could do with a bit of work as well but it is getting better all the time.</p><p name="9c90" id="9c90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest shock is how much I enjoying the chase for new business. I really like identifying opportunities and then working on the proposals and pitches.</p><p name="ea0d" id="ea0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Less surprising was how much I enjoyed the ability to move from assignment to assignment. I’ve always had professional attention deficit disorder so the fact I have been able to work at DVLA, the BBC (a lifetime ambition!), the Hydrographic Office and MHCLG in a year — with a major charity on the horizon — has been amazing. Also just look at that client list — ‘internet of public service’ writ large.</p><p name="96d3" id="96d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Living out of a backpack in some not always great hotels (plus some brutal 5 hour commutes) has been the downside though I am finding the hotel bit much easier now I have a routine.</p><p name="921e" id="921e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notbinary are still a really small team — just one that punches way above its weight. I’ve enjoyed getting to know my colleagues over the year but the nature of things is I still haven’t really worked directly with many of them — I’m hoping this will change.</p><p name="e952" id="e952" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I never really expected to find myself so involved in the strategy and direction of the company. I really feel like I have a say in everything from hiring to marketing and my ideas about an open organisation are starting to take hold.</p><p name="2c02" id="2c02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being part of a ‘group’ that ‘went public’ in December remains something that is both exciting and confusing to me — it really does open up all kinds of opportunities that I never expected. Hell the group even owns a magazine now (I always fancied my own column!!).</p><p name="bea9" id="bea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also the fact that the founders are inclined to back me in backing the events and communities that have been so important to me over the years is amazing — sponsoring Govcamp and <a href="https://yougotthis.io/" data-href="https://yougotthis.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouGotThis</a> as well as something like <a href="https://royalhackaway.com/" data-href="https://royalhackaway.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Royal Hackaway</a>.</p><p name="c52b" id="c52b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Anyway we are starting to hire more people — bringing in the amazing <a href="https://medium.com/u/5b757213c557" data-href="https://medium.com/u/5b757213c557" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="5b757213c557" data-action-value="5b757213c557" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Thayer Prime</a> to help us for a bit to get things moving — especially delivery/product-y people and engineers (both software and data flavoured) and assuming you can cope with the occasional bit of hotel living I really do wholeheartedly recommend working with us. If only for the Christmas party at the top of the Shard :)</p></div></div></section>
