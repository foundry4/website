Pretty soon I saw and experienced that when a team was working well, results were stellar. What took me much longer was figuring out how to do it on purpose. I‘m going to map that journey for you.</blockquote><figure name="22ca" id="22ca" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 465px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*UGX5iy_vuFrICPPWcdjYXw.jpeg" data-width="4426" data-height="2943" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UGX5iy_vuFrICPPWcdjYXw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AZMmUy2qL6A?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" data-href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AZMmUy2qL6A?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kimson Doan</a> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AZMmUy2qL6A" data-href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AZMmUy2qL6A" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/photos/AZMmUy2qL6A</a></figcaption></figure><p name="a473" id="a473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Microactions.

Not about me, about the trust signals.</p><p name="e39b" id="e39b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the fascinating things about a life of consulting, freelancing and building startups is that when it comes to team and organisational cultures, I’ve seen plenty. I’ve been through the good, the bad and the downright ugly. To be clear, my own companies, whether building them or just working for them have been as fascinating as the client, customer and partner organisations I’ve experienced. </p><p name="5c90" id="5c90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me, culture is the air you breathe in an organisation. If it’s clean, you’re going to go from strength to strength over the long term. What you can achieve is going to be multiplied. If it’s poor quality, you might be able to struggle through, but your long-term health will suffer. If it’s toxic, the whole thing is going to fail suddenly and catastrophically.</p><p name="04b7" id="04b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m taking it as read that you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t believe in the power of culture. If you want specifics, I can thoroughly recommend everything in this map. There’s a wealth of evidence, from neuroscience to anthropology to statistics. </p><p name="096f" id="096f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A word of encouragement. No one is perfect, no one is pointing in the right direction all the time and that’s ok. The question is which direction you think is “good” and are you able to make some progress towards it whilst continuing to evaluate what you believe is good.</p><h4 name="903e" id="903e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why culture?</h4><p name="c197" id="c197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve had dark times and I’ve had some amazing experiences. My first startup, working on the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk" data-href="https://www.ons.gov.uk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ONS</a> public website, as well as re-implementing the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" data-href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Rail Enquiries</a> website are highlights, with friendships and connections that have continued long beyond the projects. Despite a couple of howlers, I feel I’ve had more than a fair share of good experiences. And not just good, exceptional. </p><p name="4dcb" id="4dcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I’m lucky. Perhaps I’m a warm and friendly person to work with (I really wasn’t in my early days!). I think it has a lot to do with explicitly focusing on culture. Intentionally figuring out whether and why it’s important and then trying, over and over, to build cultures that work for people and noticing that this had huge upside for the outcomes of projects. </p><h4 name="aba2" id="aba2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What is culture?</h4><p name="bca7" id="bca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When I say culture, it turns out I actually mean relationships — the network of interactions between people. Whether you’re building software, a team or a company, these are all systems. Looking at these from a systems thinking point of view, it’s clear that, no matter how good the individual components, nothing is going to work if the interactions between them don’t work.</p><p name="de9f" id="de9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gottman</p><p name="fcce" id="fcce" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><blockquote name="4b1b" id="4b1b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">No matter how hard the work, success was multiplied by good culture, and the people involved had some of the best times of their careers. Me included. I’ve spent years since then figuring out how to do it on purpose. It’s how I do everything I do now.</blockquote><h4 name="1f39" id="1f39" class="graf graf--h4 graf--empty graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing"><br></h4></div></div></section>
